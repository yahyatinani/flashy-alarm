v1.0.0
- Now you can configure the lighting pattern of the flashlight/torch: static/fixed, blinking or signal.
- Also, you can set the flashlight/torch speed/frequency: [100ms ~ 1000ms.].
- Now dismissing the alarm alert turns off the flashlight/torch too.
- The app is even more easier to use by reducing the number of steps to enable the service from 2 taps (in v0.0.1) to 1 tap (v1.0.0).
- Complete rework of the app: new UI.
- Reduced the size of the app from 10 MiB to 1.5 MiB.
