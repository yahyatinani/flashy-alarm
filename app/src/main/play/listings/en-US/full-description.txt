Awaken fully with this app that automatically triggers your phone's flashlight/torch when your alarm goes off during early morning darkness.

Tested on Samsung's stock alarm app and LineageOS alarm app.

How to use:
1. On Android 13, You're asked to allow the app to post a notification for the foreground service. (optional)
2. Toggle the switch to turn the alarm listener service on or off.
3. That's all!

CAUTION:
Be careful not to put the phone close to your eyes since the flashlight can hurt your eyes!
Instead, leave it at least one meter away from you so the light can gently wake you up.

Permissions:
- It needs android.permission.FLASHLIGHT to turn on the flashlight/torch.
- It needs android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE to run the alarm listener service.
- It needs android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS to post the foreground service notification.
