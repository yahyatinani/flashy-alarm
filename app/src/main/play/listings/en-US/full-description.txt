You may want your camera's flashlight (android.hardware.camera.flash) to be turned on automatically when your alarm goes off in early dark mornings to help your body fully wake up.
This app does just that.
Tested on Samsung's stock alarm app and LineageOS alarm app.

How to use: toggle the switch to turn the service on or off. That's all!

Permissions:
- It needs android.permission.FLASHLIGHT to turn on the flashlight.
- It runs a notification listener service (android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE) in order to catch the alarm notification when it goes off to turn on the flashlight.
